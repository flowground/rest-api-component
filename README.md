# REST API component

The **REST API component** is a simple yet powerful component that allows you to connect to any REST API without programming your own components and deploying them into the platform.

The REST API component will perform a single REST API call when executed. Incoming data can gets used to configure the API call made and the response from the API call will be the output.

## Introduction

The example below shows the development team creation using the REST API component with our own [REST API service](https://api.elastic.io/docs "elastic.io REST API service").

![alt text](https://cdn.elastic.io/documentation/restapi-component-featuresv2.png "REST API component features")
*Numbers show: (1) HTTP methods, (2) the URL of the REST API resource, (3) the HTTP call headers and (4) the body of the HTTP request.*

1.  REST API component supports the following HTTP methods: `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `DELETE` and `PATCH`.
2.  The URL of the REST API accepts JSONata expressions, meaning the URL address evaluates [JSONata](http://jsonata.org/) expressions.
3.  Definition of request [headers](#defining-http-headers)
4.  Definition of request [body](#defining-http-body), if the HTTP method is not `GET`

## Enable debug logging

The component supports extended logging. `Enable debug logging` checkbox should be enabled for it. After that you may check your logs in the logs console. 

*Note:* in case of using **ordinary flows**, adding of `DEBUG` environment variable in component repository will override disabled `Enable debug logging` checkbox during flow run, so all logs will be extended until an environment variable is removed.

## Authorisation methods

To use the REST API component with any restricted access API provide the authorisation information.

![alt text](https://cdn.elastic.io/documentation/restapi-component-auth.png "REST API component Basic authorisation")
*Example above shows how to add the username/password to access the API during the integration flow design.*

You can add the authorisation methods during the integration flow design or by going to your `Settings > Security credentials > REST client` and adding there.

REST API component supports 3 authorisation types:

*   `No Auth` - use this method to work with any open REST API
*   `Basic Auth` - use it to provide login credentials like **username/password**
*   `API Key Auth` - use it to provide `API Key` to access the resource

Please note that the result of creating a credential is an HTTP header automatically placed for you. You can also specify the authorisation in the headers section directly.

## Defining HTTP headers

Use this section to add the request headers.

![alt text](https://cdn.elastic.io/documentation/rest-api-component-headers-get.png "REST API component Headers field")

Each header has a name and a value. Header name should be colon-separated name-value pairs in clear-text `string` format. The header value can use [JSONata](http://jsonata.org/) expressions.

## Defining request body

The body may be defined if the HTTP method is not `GET`. The **body** tab enables configuration options such as the **content type** drop-down menu and the **body input field**.

Here is the list of all supported **content types**:

*   `multipart/form-data`
*   `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
*   `text/plain`
*   `application/json`
*   `application/xml`
*   `text/xml`
*   `text/html`

The **body input field** changes according to the chosen content type.

### Sending JSON data

Here is how to send a JSON data in the body. Change the **content type** to `application/json` and the **body input part** would change accordingly to accept JSON object. Please note that this field supports [JSONata](http://jsonata.org) expressions.

![alt text](https://cdn.elastic.io/documentation/restapi-component-body-json-var.png "REST API component Body sending JSON data")
*Example shows the JSON in the body where the `name` parameter value gets mapped using the value of `project_name` from the previous step of integration.*

### Sending XML data

To send an `XML` data set the content type to `application/xml` or `text/xml` and place the `XML` in the body input field between double-quotes like:

```
"
<note>
  <to>" & fname & "</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>
"
```
Use a JSONata expression to include and map any values coming from the previous steps. It will replace the variable with a real value in the final mapping. Note that the rest of `XML` gets passed as a `string`.

### Sending Form data

To send a form data two content types are available:

*   `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` - used to submit simple values to a form
*   `multipart/form-data` - used to submit (non-alphanumeric) data or file attachment in payload

In both cases the payload gets transmitted in the message body.

In case of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type add the necessary parameters by giving the name and the values like:

![alt text](https://cdn.elastic.io/documentation/restapi-component-body-form-simple.png "REST API component Body sending a simple form")
*Please note that parameter value fields support [JSONata](http://jsonata.org) expressions.*

This HTTP request would submit `key1=value1&key2=value2` in the message body.

In case of `multipart/form-data` content type add the parameters similarly.

![alt text](https://cdn.elastic.io/documentation/restapi-component-body-form-complex.png "REST API component Body sending a complex form")

The transmitted HTTP request body would be:

```
--__X_ELASTICIO_BOUNDARY__
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="part1"

Please note that this fields supports [JSONata](http://jsonata.org) expressions.
--__X_ELASTICIO_BOUNDARY__
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="part2"

<p>Some more text</p>
--__X_ELASTICIO_BOUNDARY__--
```

Notice how different parts get separated by the boundary. This form is capable of supporting attachments as well.

### Working with XML

This component will try to parse XML content types in the HTTP Response assuming the `Content-Type` header has a
**MIME Content Type** with `xml` in it (e.g. `application/xml`). 
In this case response body will be parsed to JSON using `xml2js` node library and following settings:

```js
{
    trim: false,
    normalize: false,
    explicitArray: false,
    normalizeTags: false,
    attrkey: '_attr',
    tagNameProcessors: [
        (name) => name.replace(':', '-')
    ]
}
```

for more information please see the 
[Documenattion of XML2JS library](https://github.com/Leonidas-from-XIV/node-xml2js#options)

## HTTP Headers 

You can to get HTTP response header only if ``Don`t throw Error on Failed Calls`` option is checked.
In this case output structure of component will be: 
```js
    {
      headers:<HTTP headers>,
      body:<HTTP response body>,
      statusCode:<HTTP response status code>
      statusMessage:<HTTP response status message>
    }
```
## Redirection
If you want disable Follow Redirect functionality, you can use option ``Follow redirect mode``.

By default ``Follow redirect mode`` option has value ``Follow redirects`` 

## Attachments
Rest API component has opportunity of binary data sending. You just need choose ``multipart/form-data`` Content type and attachments from input message will be included to the request payload automatically.

Rest-api component automatically load binary data to attachments with next content types in response headers:
* image/*
* text/csv
* application/msword
* application/msexcel
* application/pdf
* application/octet-stream

## Exception handling
Rest API component uses exception handling logic below: 
![Exception handling logic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13310949/41960520-9bd468ca-79f8-11e8-83f4-d9b2096deb6d.png)

## Known Limitations

The component can parse any of json and xml content types. 
There are:
* application/json
* application/xml
* text/xml
* etc.

`If content type is not  exists  in response header, component will try parse response as json. 
If it get parse exception, it return response as is.`

> Make sure not to perform your tests using the [requestb.in](https://requestb.in/) since it responds with the `content-type: text/html`.

Here are some further limitation of the REST API component:

*   The component can't handle multi-part responses
